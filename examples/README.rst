This directory contains a few example detectors off of demo data. Those are not
meant to be examples of SignalFx detectors; for this, refer to the `SignalFlow
library`_ or the `SignalFlow documentation`_. Instead, those are just meant as
a directory with a few detector files to use as a demonstration of the detector
sync utility.
